# 🐾 Pet Health Assessment Expert System

A Flask-based expert system for assessing pet health conditions using machine learning. Users can select their pet type, age, and observed symptoms to get a predicted condition, severity score, and emergency alert — with results saved to a local SQLite database.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 **Expert System** using Decision Tree Classifier
- ✅ Supports multiple pet types (dog, cat, rabbit, bird, hamster)
- 🩺 Predicts health condition based on selected symptoms
- 🚨 Flags emergency conditions based on known medical indicators
- 💾 Saves all assessments to a SQLite database
- 📜 View full history of assessments
- 🎨 Clean, responsive web UI with custom CSS for each page

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects pet type, age, and symptoms
2. The model (trained using decision trees) predicts the most likely condition
3. If the condition or symptoms are flagged as emergency, the user is alerted
4. Results are scored and saved to a local SQLite database
5. Users can view all past assessments via the history page

## 🐾 Supported Pet Types

* 🐶 Dog
* 🐱 Cat
* 🐰 Rabbit
* 🐦 Bird
* 🐹 Hamster

> You can extend this easily by adding more rows to `pet_allergy_dataset.csv`.

## 📊 Dataset Format

`pet_allergy_dataset.csv`:

```csv
pet_type,symptom,possible_condition,severity,emergency
dog,difficulty breathing,respiratory distress,high,1
cat,lethargy,feline leukemia,high,1
rabbit,loss of appetite,GIT stasis,high,1
...
```
